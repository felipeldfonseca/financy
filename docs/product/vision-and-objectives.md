# Product Vision & Objectives

## Problem Statement

**Financial management remains fragmented and anxiety-inducing for individuals and families**, despite the proliferation of fintech solutions. Current challenges include:

### Core Problems
1. **Context Switching Overhead**: Users must actively remember to track expenses across multiple apps, spreadsheets, and categories
2. **Collaboration Friction**: Shared financial management (couples, families, roommates) requires complex coordination and reconciliation
3. **Future Uncertainty**: Lack of automatic tracking for subscriptions and installments creates cash flow anxiety
4. **Input Complexity**: Traditional financial apps require structured data entry that interrupts natural workflow
5. **Privacy vs. Sharing**: No clean separation between personal financial privacy and collaborative transparency

### Pain Points
- **Forgotten Transactions**: 67% of users miss recording expenses leading to budget inaccuracy
- **Subscription Surprise**: Average household has 12+ active subscriptions with 30% forgotten
- **Family Coordination**: Couples spend 2+ hours monthly reconciling shared expenses
- **Multi-Currency Confusion**: Global users struggle with currency conversion and tracking
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Complex dashboards prevent quick financial insights

## Product Vision

**Financy transforms conversational messaging into structured financial intelligence, enabling effortless personal and collaborative money management through natural language interactions.**

### Core Vision Statement
"Make financial tracking as natural as sending a message to a friend, while providing the depth and insights of professional financial tools."
